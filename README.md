Sentiment Analysis using python

- Pos.txt and Neg.txt which contains positive and negative words; one word per line

- Use these words and label them as POSITIVE or NEGATIVE and this is stored in taggedTweets

- Then, assign the words and lables, eliminating words that do not contribute to the meaning of the sentence - these are called stopwords.

- Train using NaiveBayesClassifier, and if the classifier encounters a new word, it asks whether it is Positive or Negative.
